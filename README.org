* Presentation

Simple Weather is a very simple application, which gives weather forecast.

* Installation

** Preparation

Get an API key by [[https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up][Openweathermap]].


** Requirements

+ nginx and php-fpm
+ composer in your path
+ gem in your path
+ npm in your path


** Files

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/mparienti/simple-weather-app
cd simple-weather-app
gem install sass
composer install
npm install
cp app/config.php-dist app/config.php
grunt
chmod a+w cache/
#+END_SRC

then edit ~app/config.php~ to configure the API Key you got on the previous
step.


** Web server configuration

*** Nginx
Your nginx configuration should be something like
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
server
{
    listen 80;
    server_name whatever;
    root /where/you/clone/simple-weather-app/web;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.php?$args;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf;
    }
}

#+END_SRC


*** Apache
Your server configuration should point to the directory
~/where/you/clone/simple-weather-app/web~, and make sure mod_rewrite is
enabled.

The ~web~ directory contains an ~.htaccess~ file which will be enough to
make the app work.
